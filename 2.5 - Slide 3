Advantages of programming in low-level languages are:

.Programs developed using low level languages are fast and memory efficient.
2.Programmers can utilize processor and memory in better way using a low level language.
3.There is no need of any compiler or interpreters to translate the source to machine code. Thus, cuts the compilation...
4.Low level languages provide direct manipulation of computer registers and storage.
5.It can directly communicate with hardware devices.


Disadvantages of programming in low-level languages are:

Programs developed using low level languages are machine dependent and are not portable.
It is difficult to develop, debug and maintain.
Low level programs are more error prone.
Low level programming usually results in poor programming productivity.
Programmer must have additional knowledge of the computer architecture of particular machine, for programming in low...
