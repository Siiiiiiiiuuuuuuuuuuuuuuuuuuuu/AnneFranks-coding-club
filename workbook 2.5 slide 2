 Example language:
Python ,IBM PC DOS operating systems

Can do almost anything ,Very specifically made as an OS for early IBM computers 

Translated by a compiler to machine code from english instructions ,Translated by an assembler into binary machine code 

Works on nearly any ,Was coded for a very specific chipset and hardware 

Arrays and lists and such can be used ,Inputs go directly into memory individually 

Very easy to code because it's basically english with meanings ,Very difficult as it used vague instructions so was, “intellectually challenging”

Rather bulky and slow ,Very fast and efficient as the programmer uses memory directly 

slow, fast
